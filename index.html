            <p>
                My name is Frank and I am attending my first year of Computer Science currently at Lasalle College, Montreal.
                I am eager to learn, as I like to welcome new challenges and have a deep interest in Computer Science.
                Being a focused individual with a consistent work ethic and striving for a productive team dynamic are elements of
                myself that I continuously improve.
                I plan on obtaining my DEC while working my way through the program to my best, which will then ultimately further my
                chances in enrolling into a university.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now more about myself: I've lived most of my life in Montreal and Ontario, but lived in Vietnam for a couple of years when I was a toddler.
                Growing up, my friends and I would spontaneously do activities that are uncommon, such as Tree Planting. Though Tree Planting definitely sounds
                mundane, the experience that I've accumalated from it has carried me forward through my progression as an individual. Being around computers from
                a young age made me feel more in tune with technology, which helped me cultivate friendships with people of similar interests. I welcome 
                my many trials and errors, such as when I was pursuing a nursing carreer and had realized it was not for me. Finally, I've come to believing that 
                Computer Science is a path that I want to be part of my future.
